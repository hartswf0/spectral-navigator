# Spectral Navigator

An interactive web-based workspace for exploring cultural perspectives through the metaphor of spectral light.

## Overview

Spectral Navigator is a digital humanities tool that reimagines knowledge exploration through the metaphor of light spectra. It provides an innovative interface for examining how different cultural perspectives, historical narratives, and interpretative frameworks interact and create meaning through their presence and absence.

## Concept

The workspace uses the metaphor of spectral light to visualize and explore:
- Multiple cultural perspectives as intersecting light beams
- Presence and absence of historical documentation
- Areas of overlap and divergence between different interpretative frameworks
- The creation of new meanings through the interaction of different viewpoints

## Features

### Interactive Light Interface
- Prism-like visualization environment
- Adjustable light beam intensities representing different cultural perspectives
- Interactive interference patterns showing narrative overlaps
- Dimmer controls for adjusting focus on specific frameworks

### Analysis Tools
- Visualization of presence and absence in historical documentation
- Tools for exploring cultural framework intersections
- Interactive exploration of interpretative layers
- Documentation of emerging patterns and insights

### Example Use Case: Cook's Arrival in Hawaii
The workspace can be used to explore historical events through multiple cultural lenses:
- Hawaiian perspectives (ritual frameworks, chieftain hierarchy, Lono cosmology)
- British perspectives (legal norms, military hierarchy, imperial worldview)
- Documentation presence (British naval journals) vs absence (Hawaiian oral traditions)
- Intersection analysis revealing misunderstandings and multiple interpretations
